Each loop is a complete, runnable audit-and-fix system in one markdown file — a mission, an execution DAG, a hostile adversarial reviewer, and quantitative exit criteria, all sharing one contract defined in [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md).

## Quick Start

Pick a loop, paste its `RUN PROMPT` into your AI coding agent, done. No install required.

```
Run LOOP-01 on <your-repo> (scope: <api dir>)
```

The agent reads the loop file, reads [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) for the shared execution rules, and runs the whole audit end-to-end — handing you back a branch, a findings artifact, and nothing merged without your sign-off.

Three ways to use this repo:

1. **Copy-paste** — open any file in [`skills/`](skills/), copy the `RUN PROMPT` block at the bottom, paste it into Claude Code (or ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) with your target repo.
2. **Install as a skill** — each loop's frontmatter is already skill-compatible (see [Installing as a Claude Code Skill](#installing-as-a-claude-code-skill)).
3. **Clone the whole set** — `git clone` this repo and point your agent at the `skills/` folder for the full catalog.

| [07](skills/LOOP-07-infra-devops.md) | Infrastructure & DevOps | Infrastructure, Cloud & DevOps | infra-touching | Docker/K8s/Terraform/secrets/IAM/SBOM/supply-chain audit across your deployment mesh — read+plan, never live-mutates without approval. |
| [08](skills/LOOP-08-cicd-release.md) | CI/CD & Release Engineering | CI/CD & Release Engineering | branch-mutating | Pipeline audit: is CI *actually* running, caching, test gating, artifact signing, rollback automation, canary/blue-green, feature flags. |
| [09](skills/LOOP-09-data-layer.md) | Data Layer Integrity | Data Architecture & Persistence | infra-touching | Schema/migration safety, FK/orphan/cascade audit, index coverage, RLS/grant self-escalation sweep, backup **restore** verification. |
| [10](skills/LOOP-10-ai-security.md) | AI Security Red-Team | Governance, Compliance & Risk | read-only | Red-teams your own AI stack: prompt injection, RAG/memory/embedding poisoning, model supply chain, jailbreaks, goal drift, reward hacking. |

| [12](skills/LOOP-12-test-mutation-chaos.md) | Test, Mutation & Chaos | Continuous Evaluation | branch-mutating | Closes coverage gaps, mutation-tests your suite to find tests that don't actually test anything, injects chaos (DB/cache/LLM/MCP failures). |
| [13](skills/LOOP-13-drift-debt.md) | Architectural Drift & Debt | Continuous Evaluation | read-only | Detects layer violations, circular deps, dead APIs/services; scores technical debt 0–100 across six axes, trended over time. |
| [14](skills/LOOP-14-governance-telemetry.md) | Governance & Telemetry | Runtime Observability | read-only | Audits the autonomous system itself: is it improving, looping, degrading, wasting tokens, or getting less reliable? |
| [15](skills/LOOP-15-self-optimization.md) | Self-Optimization Meta-Loop | Continuous Evaluation | branch-mutating (loops only) | The recursive-improvement loop: failure → root cause → fix → generalized pattern → proposed diff to the loops themselves. Human-gated always. |

**Risk classes:** `read-only` never touches your code · `branch-mutating` works only on an isolated loop branch, never main · `infra-touching` reads live infrastructure and proposes plans, never applies changes without explicit approval. (Same three classes apply to the five meta-loops below.)

## Meta-Loops — Loops That Run the Other 15

LOOP-01 through LOOP-15 each audit one fixed surface. The five loops below take *other loops* — or a plain-language goal — as their input instead. Notation below: `[NN + NN]` = loops feeding in, `→` = then, `?` = branch point.

**[LOOP-20 — Goal Pipeline](skills/LOOP-20-goal-pipeline.md) is the one to start with** — the front door. Hand it a goal in plain English and it plans, checks, and dispatches the other 19 for you. Everything below is a tool LOOP-20 already knows how to reach for.

---

**[16 — Fan-Out Orchestrator](skills/LOOP-16-fanout-orchestrator.md)** · `branch-mutating`
Split one task into independent pieces, run each on its own worker in parallel, no waiting on the slowest one.
```
16: [01 + 02 + 07] → prove independent → 3 workers run parallel → collect → merge report
```
*Example: backend audit, frontend audit, and infra audit don't touch the same files — run all three at once instead of one after another.*
Pairs with: any two+ loops with non-overlapping scope · gated by LOOP-20's DAG proof.

**[17 — Sparring Partners](skills/LOOP-17-sparring-partners.md)** · `branch-mutating`
Standing attacker vs. defender match on one artifact — keeps something already audited from rotting back to unsafe.
```
17: breaker=[10] vs builder=[01] → shared findings/fix queue → round N → trend to human
```
*Example: LOOP-10 keeps red-teaming your auth module, LOOP-01 keeps patching what it finds, LOOP-12 regression-tests every builder fix so nothing silently reverts.*
Pairs with: 10 (breaker's toolkit) + 01/05 (builder's toolkit) + 12 (regression backstop).

**[18 — The Ratchet](skills/LOOP-18-the-ratchet.md)** · `branch-mutating`
Change one thing, measure, keep it only if proven better — never batches, never un-welds.
```
18: [06 + 15] mutate → 11 debate → pass? weld : revert + loop
```
*Example: LOOP-06 finds a UX patch candidate, LOOP-15 generalizes it into one testable change, LOOP-11 adversarially debates whether it's actually an improvement — pass welds it permanently, fail reverts and the ratchet tries a different single change next round.*
Pairs with: any loop that has one number/patch to tune (06, 08 timeouts, 12 fuzz corpus size) + 11 for the verdict.

**[19 — Idea Arena](skills/LOOP-19-idea-arena.md)** · `read-only`
Diverse candidate ideas, one shared debate-and-mutation arena, one converged idea with a paper trail.
```
19: idea1=[13 debt] + idea2=[14 drift] + idea3=[10 gap] → arena debate+mutate → converged idea → handoff
```
*Example: three loops each surface a different "what should we fix next" candidate — the arena doesn't just pick one, it merges the strongest parts of all three into one spec, then hands it to LOOP-20 to plan and dispatch.*
Pairs with: any loops with open findings to seed candidates from + 11 (final gate on the handoff) + 20 (receives it).

**[20 — Goal Pipeline](skills/LOOP-20-goal-pipeline.md)** · `read-only→branch` · **flagship**
Plain-language goal in, validated dependency-checked plan out, dispatched into whichever of 01–19 fit.
```
20: goal="harden API + dedupe code" → decompose → [01] + [13] independent → 16 fan-out → 11 reviews plan → dispatch
```
*Example: one goal implies two unrelated tasks — LOOP-20 proves they don't conflict, hands both to LOOP-16 to run in parallel instead of you manually sequencing them, and keeps re-checking the plan as results come in.*
Pairs with: everything — this is the loop that decides which of the other 19 to run.

## How It Works

One shared contract in [`PROTOCOL.md`](PROTOCOL.md) — read it for the full spec:

- **4-step protocol** — ingest → scope → execute → adversarial check.
- **Confidence blocks** — every output scored, risk-rated, with explicit unknowns.
- **13-class failure taxonomy** — routes, never just "fails."
- **Checkpointed rollback** — every mutation on an isolated branch.
- **FREE-MAD debate** — a hostile reviewer persona before anything ships.
- **Quantitative exit criteria** — `FAIL-with-artifact` beats silent success.

## Installing as a Claude Code Skill

Each loop's YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, etc.) is already skill-shaped. To install one:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/loop-backend-api
cp skills/LOOP-01-backend-api.md ~/.claude/skills/loop-backend-api/SKILL.md
```

Repeat per loop, or copy the whole `skills/` folder and adapt the frontmatter `name` field per file. Once installed, invoke with `/loop-backend-api` (or your agent's skill-invocation syntax) instead of pasting the `RUN PROMPT` manually.

## Suggested Cadence

A reasonable starting rhythm — tune it to your team:

| Cadence | Loops |
|---|---|
| Weekly sweep | 01 (backend), 02 (frontend), 13 (drift/debt) |
| Pre-release | 08 (CI/CD), 12 (test/mutation/chaos), 06 (UX/UI) |
| Monthly deep audit | 07 (infra), 09 (data layer), 10 (AI security), 05 (memory) |
| Continuous / every N runs | 14 (governance), then 15 (self-optimization) |
